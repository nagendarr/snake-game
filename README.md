Developed a Classic Snake Game in Java, replicating the retro arcade experience with smooth gameplay and responsive controls. The game features a 10px per joint snake, controlled using cursor keys, starting with three joints and growing upon consuming apples. Implemented collision detection to ensure the snake avoids walls and itself, triggering a "Game Over" message upon failure. Focused on game logic, rendering, and event handling to create an engaging user experience.
